To see the output in the two desired formats (JSON, human-readable), first run the "movieawards.py" file with
the desired year in the terminal (e.g. movieawards.py 2013) to see the results for the 2013 Golden Globes Show.

Then, to view the human-readable format run the "humanread.py" with the same year in the terminal
(e.g. humanread.py 2013), which takes the previous JSON file & converts it to a readable .txt file format.
