To see the output in the two desired formats (JSON, human-readable), first run the "movieawards.py" file with
the desired year in the terminal (e.g. movieawards.py 2013) to see the results for the 2013 Golden Globes Show.

Then, to view the human-readable format run the "humanread.py" with the same year in the terminal
(e.g. humanread.py 2013), which takes the previous JSON file & converts it to a readable .json file format.


For sentiment analysis, we ran the analysis on the hosts, golden globe parties, and winners. The raw results of the analysis are in the /data/sentresults* files, the stats on the analysis (mean, max polarity, min polarity, etc.) are in /data/sentstats* files, and the final average sentiment of the hosts, golden globe parties, and winners are in the /data/finalanalysis* files.
